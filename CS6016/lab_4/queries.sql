WHERE ISBN = '978-0062278791' -- change ISBN in quotes to filter
ORDER BY Serial DESC;

-- 3. Get the Serial numbers and ISBNs of all books checked out by <Patronâ€™s name>
SELECT ISBN,
       I.Serial
FROM Patrons AS p
         JOIN CheckedOut AS co
              ON p.CardNum = co.CardNum
         JOIN Inventory AS I
              ON I.Serial = co.Serial
WHERE p.Name = 'Joe';
-- Change name of person to filter

-- 4. Get phone number(s) and Name of anyone with <ISBN> checked out
SELECT Name,
       Phone
FROM Patrons AS p
         JOIN CheckedOut AS co
              ON p.CardNum = co.CardNum
         JOIN Inventory AS I

WHERE ISBN = '978-0062278791';
-- Change ISBN to filter
